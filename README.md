# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction

Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor.

models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest,
and lowest stock prices of every month
