Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor.
Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive
models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest,
and lowest stock prices of every month


The primary purpose of this prediction is to help investors and traders make informed decisions about buying or selling Yes Bank's stock. The regression model can provide a quantitative estimate of the expected price movement, which can be used to evaluate the risk and return associated with an investment in Yes Bank's stock. Additionally, these predictions can also help financial analysts to assess the overall health and performance of the company, and provide recommendations to clients about their investment strategy.
